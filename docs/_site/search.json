    "section": "4.1 Prototype Construction",
    "text": "4.1 Prototype Construction\n\nFrame / Workbench\nThe construction of the structural frame of the workbench is a crucial step in assembling the HDPE bottle pre-cleaning station prototype. This frame is crafted by welding metal tubes together, forming a sturdy base that supports the various modules of the station. The geometry of the workbench can be adapted according to local requirements and the available space. The width of the frame should be chosen, such that the sink can be inserted. When determining the dimensions of the frame, special attention is given to its height, which is to be selected to ensure comfortable usage (90-100cm).\n\n\nInflation Module\nThe realization of the inflation module is kept as simple as possible and is presented in Figure 4a). The module consists of a round tube welded to a steel plate. The diameter of the tube is approximately 1cm smaller than the bottle opening to ensure quick and reliable mounting of the bottle. The steel plate is welded to or screwed onto the surface on the workbench below the module.\n\n Figure 4: 3D-representation of modules: a) Inflation Module, b) Cleaning Module.\n\n\n\nCleaning Module\nThe cleaning interface depicted in Figure 4b) consists of four primary components. It incorporates a brush, a faucet, a sink, and a glass rinser, each playing a specific role in the cleaning process. Constructing the cleaning module requires planning regarding the placement and installation of the tap and glass rinser. If the sink is being custom manufactured, the design must include holes for both the tap and rinser to ensure a seamless integration. On the other hand, if a pre-made sink is used, an additional hole may need to be drilled to accommodate the glass rinser. In the next step, the sink can be inserted into the workbench allowing to install the tap and rinser. Next, the brush is affixed to a custom holder which can be screwed or welded to the workbench. Since water drops should be captured by the sink, the brush holder is attached last, to ensure that the base of the brush is aligned with the wall of the sink.\n\n\nWater Module\nFigure 5 illustrates the components of the water module. Initially, the placement of the pump and pressure tank must be determined. Following this, a rubber hose is cut to the required length to link all components. Typically, these components are equipped with threaded ends, allowing for the attachment of an threaded hose nipple. The hose is then attached to the components and fastened securely with hose clamps. Adding the clamps is crucial since the system operates under pressure, necessitating a tight and secure connection to prevent leaks and maintain system integrity. The schematic in Figure 5 also displays the order in which the components are installed. In the following a quick functional summary of the different parts is given:\n\n Figure 5: Schematic of the water module utilized to generate water pressure.\n\n\nManual Piston Pump: A manual piston pump is used to pump water into the closed system.\nDirt Filter: The water first passes through a dirt filter to remove sand, dirt, and other particles. This filtering process is essential to protect sensitive valves downstream.\nOne-Way Valve: A one-way valve is used to maintain the generated pressure within the piping system while pumping. This is done by restricting upstream flow through a spring mechanism.\nPressure Tank: The filtered water enters a pressure tank, where the work introduced by the manual pump is converted into air pressure. When the water outlet (glass rinser/tap) is closed, the amount of air particles inside the pressure tank remains constant. As more water is pumped into the closed system, the air inside the pressure tank is compressed, exerting a certain force on the water. This pressure is utilized to operate the glass rinser and tap, even if they are located at a higher position than the pressure tank.\nPressure Regulation: The pre-cleaning setup is designed to work at 2.5 bars of pressure. To ensure worker safety, a barometer to read off current pressure levels, and a pressure-limiting safety valve is included. The spring-loaded mechanism of the safety valve automatically opens if the water pressure inside the pipes exceeds 2.5 bars.\nWater access: The water pressure can be accessed through the tap or the glass rinser.\n\n\n\nStacking Module\nThe bottles are cut using two blades arranged in a cross-like manner. This cutting method allows to bend the walls of the bottle outward while leaving the bottle opening intact. The bottles are then stacked on top of each other onto a pole. As depicted in Figure 6, the cutting tool consists of an outer tube, an inner tube, a cutting interface, and a bottle adapter. The outer and inner tubes are connected via joints, allowing manual operation through a handle. Manually pulling on the lever causes the force to be transmitted through the joints, leading to linear movement of the inner tube. The inner tube acts as a sled for the cutting interface, moving linearly within the outer tube. The cutting interface itself consists of a plate with vertically aligned blades, angled to enhance cutting efficiency.\nConstruction Steps:\n\nPrepare the Tubes: Begin by fixing the dimensions of the outer and inner tubes, ensuring they align correctly for smooth operation. The tubes can be cut out of a single piece of metal tubing and/or angle bars. Attach the top hinge as well as the adapter bracings to opposite ends of the outer tube.\nAssemble the Cutting Interface: Attach the vertically aligned blades to the horizontal plate. Further weld the bottom hinge to the top side of the plate. This assembly is then welded to the end of the inner tube.\nInstall the joint mechanism: Begin constructing the mechanism by fabricating the handle from metal tubing and cutting three flat bars to the lengths specified (CAD files available in the Git repository). Proceed to drill holes at where the joints will be located. Following this, weld the handle to the long flat bar at a right angle (90°). To assemble the mechanism, join its components by screwing them together, ensuring it is securely connected to both the outer tube and the cutting interface.\nInstall the Bottle Adapter: The bottle adapter, crucial for positioning the bottle during the cutting process, attaches to the outer tube with help of 4 screws. The adapter’s walls assist in centering the bottle, while a metal tube with vertical cuts welded onto the adapter offers counterpressure, ensuring a clean cut and protecting the user from the blades.\nAdd the cutting tool to the workbench: The cutting tool can be horizontally welded or screwed to the workbench or vertically attached to a wall.\n\n\n Figure 6: 3D- representation of the cutting module: a) Complete Assembly, b) Explosion view of the handle and joints, c) Explosion view of the inner tube with blades attached, d) Explosion view of the outer tube with the bottle adapter attached."

    "text": "4.2 Prototype Operation\nThis manual leads users through the process of operating the bottle pre-cleaning station. The setup can be used to transform crushed and dirty HDPE bottles into clean, cut, and ready-for-recycling materials.\n\nPreparing the setup\n\nStart by inserting the pump into a bucket of water and manually operate the handle to generate water pressure within the system. This is achieved by moving the pump handle in a back-and-forth motion until the desired pressure, indicated by the barometer, is reached.\nMake sure that the safety valve is properly functional by twisting the red cap. It is important to always have an eye on the pressure gauge to see whether the pressure is within limits or dropped over time.\nAfter a certain period of using the pressurized water, the manual pump needs to be re-operated to reach the desired pressure level again.\n\n\n\nSorting and Inspection\nSort the HDPE bottles, and remove any items placed within. Inspect each bottle for excessive damage that could hinder the cleaning process.\n\n\nInflation\nIn case a bottle is crushed, mount it onto the inflation module and manually wiggle the bottle around the vertical tube to inflate it back to its original shape.\n\n\nRemoval of material contaminants and soaking\nRemove the bottle’s lid and label by peeling them off the bottle. If necessary, use a knife or a sharp edge to start loosening the label before peeling it off. Once the material contaminants are removed, put a first batch of bottles into a bucket of water to soak the entire surface of the bottle, reducing the workload of the main cleaning steps. Soaked in water for a minute, the bottles are ready for the next steps.\n\n\nCleaning and Drying\nQuickly rinse the bottle under the tap to remove loose dirt and debris. Press the bottle upside-down onto the glass rinser and use the manual brush to thoroughly clean both the interior and exterior of the bottle.\nThis step may need to be repeated a couple of times in case of heavily soiled bottles. Once the bottles are clean, place the cleaned bottles onto the vertical pins to allow excess water to drip out before cutting. The rinsing step as well as the temporary bottle storage are visualized in Figure 7.\n\n Figure 7: Cleaning Process of HDPE bottles. The vertical pins act as temporary storage of cleaned bottles.\n\n\n\nCutting\nOnce the bottle is clean and dry, place it into the stacking module. Place the bottle into the adapter and manually operate the handle to activate the cutting tool. The blades, arranged in a cross-like manner, should cut the bottle while preserving the opening intact. This process prepares the bottle for efficient stacking.\n\n\nInspection and Storage\nInspect the cut and cleaned bottle for any missed contaminants, and if necessary, remove the remains. Place the bottles through the opening onto the transport unit (pole) as represented in Figure 8.\n\n Figure 8: 3D-representation of the loading process. Bottles are stacked on the pole and slide into the rail."
